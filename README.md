============

An iPad web application to let you search for current weekly courses by songs.


The Challenge
-------------

I wanted to create an iPad web application that feels like a native application, without using full featured
libraries like [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) or [SproutCore Touch](http://www.sproutcore.com/).
This is the result.


Browser Support
---------------

* Firefox 3.6
* Safari 5
* MobileSafari on iPad (iOS 3.2)


Powered By
----------

* [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) for fetching data
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
* [My Modified Version of iScroll](https://code.google.com/r/orgyidttvb-iscroll-js/) for scrolling on the iPad.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for styling
